<p style="margin-top:10px;">Each Americans waste 4.51 pounds per person per day(EPA, 2017). <br>However, many Americans are not aware of this problem. Moreover, no one talks about how to reduce waste and consumers donâ€™t have a choice to but eco-friendly products at all.
Our organization aims to provide community with affordable and accessible zero-waste products through offline/online shops.
<br>We will run craft classes with information session.<br>
We will run environmental campaigns to impact legislature. Our final goal is to influence companies to produce eco-friendly products through a legislature movement.</p>
